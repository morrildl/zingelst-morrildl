Notes on the new PX74:

- general idea is a highly-fluid RTS with extensive UI features; calling it a
  RTT (Real Time Tactical) sim.

Game Map:
- Netrek-like
- Many planets
- Each player starts off w/ a Homeworld and a dominion
- Conquers planets a la Netrek
- As players' planets are conquered, they drop out of the game

Planets:
- Add to the owning player's resources -- Capability Level
- Have some defensive capability
- Each planet has different contribution mix
	- Military?
	- Tech?
	- Raw Materials?
	- Respawn point?
- Can have limited beef-ups (e.g. better defense, starport)
- "Unique" or Strategic planets (e.g. capture a planet that gives you some
  special tech or ability)

Capability Level (CL):
- Potentially multidimensional
	- Tech level - Determines what weapons are available
	- Military/People - Determines recharge rates, build rates, and size of
	  ships
	- Materials - Determines how many can be built, and may enable
	  other things (e.g. alloys for armor)
- Split into two: current vs. max
	- current = max - allocated
- CL max is the sum of CLs of all planets possessed by player
- CL allocated is the sum of all CLs consumed by units extant for a player
- When a unit build is started, resources consumed immediately up front
- When a unit is destroyed, ticks count UP as unit destroyed unit's resources
  are returned to the pool
- CLs can be allocated (more or less permanently) for some things -- i.e. global
  tech upgrades (planetary defense, etc.)

Units:
- Do not spawn immediately; have a build time in ticks
- Subtract down from CL pool each tick until unit is done
- Can be attacked, destroyed during construction
	- (How? HP reduce til pop, but do they come off final HP, etc.?)
- When units are destroyed, they get added to the death queue
- Players can "decommission" units and reclaim their resources, but this
  functions as just destroying the unit - penalty is delay for the resource 
  regeneration time
- Can be repaired (autorepair)

UI:
- Destroyed units are already re-enqueued when they are destroyed
- Units are owned by the player who created them
- Alliance mode shares resources, but NOT units
- Also have a full co-op mode where 2 players play as one but can't de-ally
- Ability to customize units
	- add unit to queue
	- during build, add a feature <- adds to build time
		- e.g. giant beam cannon
	- can store as a design
- Possibly retrofit existing units
	- unit drops back to build mode for duration of addition

Tech tree:
- Keyed on CL
- When CL crosses the threshold/watermark, tech becomes available
  (no StarCraft-like researching required)
- Deployed tech not removed when CL falls below threshold, but new units
  cannot be built with it
