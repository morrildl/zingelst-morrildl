- collision detection
- object model
- world generation; object placement & motion model
- map data files (XML)
- weapons system object model
- weapons motion & placement engine
- sound engine
- network
- game input
- enemy AI


Sequence:
Immediate:
P - 3D model loading -> get a model into OGL as a class
P - world generation
S - game input
S - rudimentary AI (loops, patterns, if switches, etc.)

Intermediate:
- collision detection
- map data files (rudimentary)
- brainstorm on network issues
- weapons obj model
- explore sound
- weapons motion & placement

Longterm:
- visual effects
- sound effects
- explore more complex AI
- full-on map data files
- network
