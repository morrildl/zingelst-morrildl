Using CVS:
CVS is stored on a respository at obsequious.net.  To access it, you will
need an obsequious.net account.  The CVSROOT will be:
	$ export CVSROOT=:ext:${LOGNAME}@projectX74repo:/usr/local/var/cvs

(Yes, projectX74repo is a fake hostname.   More on that later.)

You will also need to use SSH to access the repository.  You can instruct CVS
to use SSH instead of RSH via the CVS_RSH variable.  On Unix, the command
looks like this, where "%" is your prompt:
	% export CVS_RSH=`which cvs`
	% cvs -d ${CVSROOT} checkout projectX74

However, depending on where you check the project out from, this may change.
SSH defaults to port 22, and CVS offers no way to pass the argument to SSH
to change this.  Thus you will need to create a ~/.ssh/config file and
create an alias -- which is where "projectX74repo" comes in.  You create an
SSH alias for that, by using this ~/.ssh/config file snippet:

Host projectX74repo
	Hostname obsequious.net
	Port 2401

If you are behind Dan's firewall, replace those contents with:

Host projectX74repo
	Hostname 192.168.0.8
	Port 22

Using this technique allows you to change servers without changing the CVSROOT
variable all the time, which is a PITA.


As a final note, the :ext: CVS form requires you to enter a password or
passphrase every time.  To avoid this, create an SSH public key and copy it
to obsequious.net as you normally would.  Then use ssh-agent.

The following demonstrates a full session:

% exec ssh-agent bash
% ssh-add
[Enter psssphrase]
% export CVS_ROOT=:ext:${LOGNAME}@projectX74repo:/usr/local/var/cvs
% cvs checkout projectX74
